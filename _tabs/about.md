## Hi. I'm Alexander. Nice to meet you.

I wrote my first line of code in 1999 and I've been hooked ever since. After a couple of years I was asked to build the first client application and I did. I always knew I wanted to code, but my path to the tech industry hasn't been a straight line. I've worked in a variety of roles that have given me a broad perspective. I have played with hardware, software, security and quality; desktop, web and mobile.

I started this blog to share my discoveries and experiences with others so you can get to know me better. Below, you'll find a list of tools I'm familiar with. Click to learn more about how I use [tools](/tags) or take a look at my [projects](/categories/projects). In the sidebar you can find my contact details.
